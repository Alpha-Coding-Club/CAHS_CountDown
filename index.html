We need to write text saying " There are _ numbers of days left"
When we get to 1 day left, we need to say "There is one day left of school!"
Last day of school is june 4th



BONUS: We should add a text saying "That's _ weekdays of school"
maybe factor in breaks/days off? -->

<h1>Countdown to Last Day of School</h1>
<h2>There is _ days of school left</h2>
<p>That means _ weekdays of school</p>
